# Game Description

The game is called "Christmas Queries". The objective of the game is to save santa from the grinch by proving your christmas spirit through answering Christmas trivia questions. The game will consist of 15 questions. Each question is worth 5 points. The user must get at least 10 out of 15 of the questions correct (minimum score of 50) to win. When the user enters the game, the program will show a welcome screen with snow falling. This will use arrays. It will ask the user to choose a level: easy, medium, or hard. The user will type in their answer, and the program will get the set of questions from the code according to the selected level using an if statement. Then, it will display first question and wait for the user to input the answer by clicking a button. There will be a timer method that gives the user 20 seconds to select their answer. After the user clicks the button, the code will use an if statement to determine if it was correct or incorrect. Then, it will use variables and mathematical expressions to calculate the new score and store the value. Then, it will use a while loop and a boolean to display the next question. This process will repeat 15 times for the 15 questions. Once all the questions have been answered, the final score will be calculated. Then, the code will tell the user if they won or lost the game using an if statement. One limitation that my program will have is that if the user plays the same level more tham once, the questions will be the same as the previous round.
