# Game Description

The game is called "Christmas Queries". The objective of the game is to save santa from the grinch by proving your christmas spirit through answering Christmas trivia questions. The game will consist of 10 questions per level. The user must get at least 7 out of 10 of the questions correct in order to win. When the user enters the game, the program will show a welcome screen with snow falling. This will use arrays. The screen explains the game, and asks the user to choose a level: easy or hard. The user will click on their answer, and the program will get the set of questions from the code according to the selected level using an if statement. Then, it will display first question and wait for the user to input the answer by pressing the key that coressponds with their answer (a, b, c, or d). After the user presses the key, the code will use an if statement to determine if it was correct or incorrect. Then, it will to calculate the new score and store the value in a variable. The user will press the right arrow to move to the next question. This process will repeat 10 times for the 10 questions. Once all the questions have been answered, the final score will be calculated. Then, the code will tell the user if they won or lost the game using an if statement. One limitation that my program will have is that if the user plays the same level more tham once, the questions will be the same as the previous round.
